# CatalystNoclip
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tremwil/CatalystNoclip/master/app.PNG)

A noclip tool for Mirrors Edge Catalyst. Although I still need to polish some stuff in it and fix some bugs, it is very reliable. There is only one feature that is left unimplemented: being able to move the camera while the game is frozen. And having a proper icon, too.
