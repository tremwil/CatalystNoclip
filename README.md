A noclip tool for Mirrors Edge Catalyst.

# How to use it
There are two noclip modes: Real-time (RT) and Frozen-Time (FT). The first one allows you to move your camera around, but suffers from graphical instability. The trick to use this mode without any hassle is to enable it while performing the crouch glitch. As for FT noclip, it freezes the game completely so it is much more stable. The disadvantages of this mode is that not only will the camera be frozen, but the game will not load unloaded areas as you approach them. If you want to change your speed, you can use the "Move Slower" and "Move Faster" hotkeys. To move around, use the keybindings you defined for the game (usually WASD). Use the key mapped to jump to go up and the one mapped to crouch to go down. To change the current noclip mode, use the "Switch Mode" hotkey. To set noclip on/off, use the "Toggle Noclip" one. 

There is another feature called NoStumble. Once its corresponding hotkey is pressed, You will not be able to die or stumble from fall damage. There is also a "Kill Yourself" button, which is there to quickly fix noclip as it only works every two deaths.
